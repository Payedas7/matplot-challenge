# Unit 5 | Assignment - The Power of Plots

As a Chief Data Analyst, I've been given access to the complete data from the most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Here my objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this I have:
*******************

Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
Created a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

As final considerations:
*************************

I have used the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
I have used the Matplotlib library.
I have included a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
I have used proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, X and Y Axis Limits, etc.
My scatter plots included error bars. This will allow the company to account for variability between mice. I wanted to look into pandas.DataFrame.sem for ideas on how to calculate that.
When making plots to consider aesthetics!
My legends should not be overlaid on top of any data.
My bar graph is indicating tumor growth as red and tumor reduction as green. It also include a label with the percentage change for each bar.
My only goal was to build the scatter plots and bar graphs correctly.
